Fjord | Chord Exploration Vehicle

Fjord is a boutique ambient synthesizer designed for immersive soundscapes and harmonic exploration. It combines a sophisticated additive synthesis engine with a specialized "Behind the Scenes" effects rack modeled after high-end hardware pedals.

Musical Capabilities

1. Harmonic Engine & Voicing
Fjord utilizes a custom additive synthesis engine capable of generating complex, harmonically rich waveforms.
Extended Voicings: Unlike standard triad-based synths, Fjord defaults to sophisticated harmonic structures including Major 9th, Minor 11th, and Dominant 13th.
Neo-Soul Mood: A curated voicing designed for modern R&B and lo-fi textures.
Genetic DNA: The Next function utilizes band-limited synthesis to evolve the "DNA" of the patch, morphing between Sine, Saw, Triangle, and Organ characteristics while randomizing ADSR envelopes.

2. Manual FX Chain (The "Behind the Scenes" Rack)
The effects are refined for organic movement and spatial depth:

Pan (Sway): A sine-based auto-panner that provides non-linear spatial movement, avoiding the "hard-center" fatigue of digital panners.

Pulse (Harmonic Tremolo): A 180° phase-offset tremolo. As the amplitude peaks in the left channel, it dips in the right, creating a "chewy," rhythmic movement classic to boutique tube amps.

Float (Divergent Sweeps): A dual-filter setup where a Low-Pass and High-Pass filter sweep in opposite directions. This creates a shifting frequency focus that maintains consistent perceived loudness while dramatically altering the timbre.

3. Performance Features
Freeze Mode: Infinite sustain for drone generation and layering.

FX Bypass: A dedicated "dry" switch that instantly centers panners, resets filter frequencies, and disables tremolo modulation without interrupting the core oscillator tails.

High-Fidelity Export: Renders the internal buffer to a 16-bit WAV file, preserving the full dynamic range of the effects chain for use in external DAWs.
